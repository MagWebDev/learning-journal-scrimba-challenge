                <h1 class="welcome">Hi! My name is Magda. I've been learning to code for almost 3 years. Join me in my
                    journey!
                </h1>
                <p class="about-me">My path to become a frontend developer isn't easy. From the beginning I've been
                    learning
                    everything by myself. I do not have any technical backround. I've started learning to code when my
                    husband
                    needed a website. It wasn't love at first site but as time goes by I'm excited to getting better at
                    coding
                    everyday.</p>

                <h2 class="faq">How it started?</h2>
                <p class="answer">I was never interested in programming, not even thought about it. But one day my
                    husband needed a website and I said, let me try. From that day with many ups and downs I'm learning
                    to code every free time I have.</p>
                <h2 class="faq">How I stay motivated?</h2>
                <p class="answer">What makes me learn? The awerness that one day I'll be able to finally work the way I
                    am and do what I like. Even if I'll never be pro in it. I like to learn, to evolve and this is what
                    keeps me learning.</p>
                <h2 class="faq">What to start with?</h2>
                <p class="answer">The best way is to learn from some kind of bootcamps, where you have your learning
                    step by step. It's important not to only binge watch everything like a seasons on Netflix ;) You
                    must practice a lot.</p>
